# WDI-GROUP-PROJECT

The Big Chill present APPrès Ski! ❄️

⛷ Patrick
🎿 Charlotte
🏂 Evelina


Monday

❄️ API - we couldn’t use because was only in XML and we could only use it on one IP address - we had to build the API from scratch

❄️ Worked well as a team - challenge that lots of things were half done - you couldn’t see through a whole project

❄️ Our detailed planning really helped us to prioritise MVP and communicate on what was going on and to help avoid conflicts on git - really helped that we had 3 models and 3 people


Tuesday

🏂 Reached MVP

🏂 Had a few issues with embedding and referencing schemas

🏂 Added auto complete function on holiday index

🏂 Fixed lots of smaller problems - radio buttons on forms, background image, styling


Wednesday

🎿 Patrick fixed yesterdays bug relating to drop down menus and embedding and referencing schemas.

🎿 Charlotte added the Google Places API

🎿 Evelina has been restyling forms and battling with radio buttons

🎿 We are struggling with having a great MVP and wanting to add too many extra features all at once. We discussed pairing back some of our plans a little.  Extra features that we have added since MVP:
Google Places API, Button to favourite Places, Drop down menus and autocomplete forms

🎿 Designed and added favicon logo
