❄️ API - we couldn’t use because was only in XML and we could only use it on one IP address - we had to build the API from scratch

❄️ Worked well as a team - challenge that lots of things were half done - you couldn’t see through a whole project

❄️ Our detailed planning really helped us to prioritise MVP and communicate on what was going on and to help avoid conflicts on git - really helped that we had 3 models and 3 people
